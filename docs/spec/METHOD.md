# How We Work (research method)

NORTH-STAR.md says **what** Fractodactyl is for. This document says **how** we go after
it. It binds every contributor, human or agent. DEC-14 records its core rule.

The reason it exists: the first decisive experiment (BENC-01) took a day to build and
about half an hour per arm to run, and it answered no. That is a fine result, but at
that pace we get one answer a day. Rendering fractals is slow, so the research loop must
not be rendering fractals.

## 1. Three gates

No hypothesis gets an expensive run until it has won a cheap one.

| Gate | Budget | Input | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Probe** | under 30 s | hundreds to a few thousand points or samples, one tile, a few tiny frames | kill or keep. Run constantly |
| **Promotion** | under 5 min | 20-50 frames at 160x90 to 320x180 | check cross-frame behaviour and an honest wall-clock time |
| **Full benchmark** | as long as it takes | the real path at real size | confirm a win the first two gates already showed |

A full benchmark that is not confirming a probe win is a mistake. If a probe cannot be
built for an idea, building the probe is the first task.

## 2. Every claim has a fair opponent

A speedup counts only against the best competitor that could adopt the same trick
without our machinery. For atlas claims, that is the independent renderer that does the
same thing per frame (BENC-01 arm B). For kernel claims, it is the current best kernel
path.

Every experiment states which question it answers:

- **Cheaper frames:** does this make a genuine frame cheaper for anyone? This serves the
  north star directly.
- **Atlas wins:** does this make compiled, reused work beat recomputing per frame? It
  wins only if what it caches is expensive to rebuild or inherently cross-frame.

Both questions are worth asking, but they must not be confused. BENC-01 confused them
until arm B separated them.

## 3. Measure cost, not just counts

Iteration counts are the fast first signal, but not the verdict. Operations differ in
cost: BENC-01 measured BLA doing fewer iterations than plain perturbation yet running
0.78-0.97x as fast between 1e-14 and 1e-29. A probe reports cost-weighted operations, or
real time on a fixed batch, next to the counts. A step reduction under about 2x is
treated as noise until real time agrees.

## 4. Frozen truth

Correctness is checked against a frozen truth pack, not recomputed each time. The pack is
a few nasty locations times about a thousand chosen points (boundary, filament, deep
minibrot, near-parabolic), computed once by the oracle at high precision and committed.
A candidate is compared in seconds. The independent oracle (tools/oracle.py) runs only
when a candidate is promoted. Errors use the oracle's measure, equivalent pixel
displacement (DEC-10).

Frozen points rank and kill; they do not promote. A per-pixel shortcut is **kept** only
after it matches fd (or the oracle) on every pixel of at least one whole frame per tested
depth (≤1e-3 px, 0 class mismatches), with the worst pixels re-checked at high precision
to see which side is wrong (DEC-17, proposed). On 2026-10-07 two configurations passed 48
frozen points and failed whole frames. Whole-frame checks run on GitHub Actions
(`gh workflow run koenigs-bench.yml`).

## 5. Generate and test

Ideas are cheap and scoring decides. Each probe ends in **one number per candidate**,
with correctness as a gate, so that many variants can be generated and ranked
automatically, including overnight by agents. The work is made searchable before it is
made clever.

## 6. Where ideas come from

- **Measured constraints.** Every idea starts from a measured bottleneck and a numeric
  target, for example: "remove the 511 fallback steps/pixel on the 32% of pixels no BLA
  block covers, using under 1 KB per tile". Vague goals produce textbook answers.
- **Forced analogies.** Map the measured problem through other fields on purpose: maps,
  video codecs, JIT and trace compilers, ray-tracing acceleration structures, multigrid,
  virtual texturing, compression, interval arithmetic. Most die. That is the point.
- **Human intuition as a constraint.** The owner's hunches ("Google Maps for fractals",
  "1-3 px features can be smooshed") are hypotheses to put through a probe, not
  decorations and not dogma.
- **Prior art first.** Before building, spend a few minutes on who did this already
  (Kalles Fraktaler, Fraktaler 3, nanomb, zoomasm, the deep-zoom forums and papers).
  Build on it. Prior art is the floor, not the destination.
- **Deep research before a new investigation.** Before opening a new line of
  investigation, the agent drafts 2-3 focused deep-research questions. The owner runs
  them as external deep-research jobs across many sources. A good question names the
  measured bottleneck, the constraints (genuine depth, error contract, bytes, CPU and
  GPU), what we already tried and measured, and the exact form the answer should take:
  methods, their cost scaling, sources, known failures. The answers are saved under
  `docs/research/<date>/` and read before the probe is designed.

## 7. Kill fast, write it down

A dead idea is a result. Record negative and positive results in the log below, with
the command and the numbers, so nobody pays for the same answer twice.

## Results log

### FIX-42: late-escape derivative fallback (pending local adjudication)

The zone's truncated return-map derivative is unreliable on late escapes. A zone
escape within 1000 iterations of max_iter is recomputed using the independent
per-pixel kernel; its entire outcome replaces the zone's (DEC-10), including an
Unresolved result. A reference orbit is built lazily only if a pixel needs fallback.
This does not cure fd's separately documented max_iter-boundary class errors.

Local validation pending: cargo test, clippy, 1280x720 frames 742/747 against
mpmath (de < 0.2%, normal < 0.2 degrees), then all 750 v0 frames.

### PROB-20: v0 film frames decided before rendering (2026-10-10)

**Measured locally** (Ryzen 9 3900X, 24 threads, 1280x720, 1 run per frame, max_iter 1e5). Command: `THREADS=24 RUNS=1 SIZE=1280x720 MAXIT=100000 bash tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_bench/run.sh target/release/fd out/prob20 bench/path-atlas-v0.txt`. Both films are single `fd control` executions over all 750 frames. In the mixed film, `fd control --zone` decides each frame before rendering it.

| Film | Wall s | Seconds in frames |
|---|---:|---:|
| fd per-frame BLA only | 629.4 | 614.7 |
| Mixed: zone on the 315 admitted frames, fd elsewhere | 267.0 | 252.3 |
| **Measured speed-up** | **2.36x** | 2.44x |

- **Admitted frames: 435-749 (315).** On those frames fd takes 383.2 s and the zone 15.8 s.
- **Correctness on every admitted frame:** 0 nu over 1e-3 px (max 7.7e-5), 0 non-finite, 0 de over 0.2% (max 0.13%), 0 normal over 0.2 deg (max 0.12).
- **Class disputes:** after the 367,389 FIX-04 pairs, 4 samples remain, and `diagnose_pixels.py` (180-digit mpmath) assigns all 4 to fd at the max_iter boundary.
  - 742 (625,291) and (603,297), 747 (730,358): fd says Unresolved, while mpmath escapes at n = 99981, 99976 and 99901. The zone has the right class and nu (1e-13 px), but its de is off by 7.4x, 33x and 3.4x and the normal by up to 153 deg. These samples are not de-scored (class differs), so this is an open zone defect on near-max_iter escapes.
  - 748 (457,177): fd escaped; mpmath and the zone are unresolved at 1e5.

**The band-top cutoff, from zone data and frame geometry.** At frames 431/432, the de errors are not from fixing the parameter at C (mpmath: 1e-16), from the Koenigs, psi or tail-patch series (more terms change nothing), or from f64 C (1e-6). They come from truncating the first return at degree 4. Its relative state error (6e-9 at |v| = 0.94e-3) moves a pixel by about 2e-6 px. Near the scored de floor (1e-3 px) that is a ~0.2% de change.
- **Bound:** the zone now carries the first return's diagonal series M(v,v) = sum S_n v^n to degree 6 (`diag` lines, mantissa + exponent). `zone_covers` bounds the shift at the frame's outer radius r as (|S5| r^5 + |S6| r^6) / (lower bound of |dM/dv| at r) / pixel spacing.
- **Rule:** admit when the bound is <= 5e-7 px, i.e. 0.2% x 1e-3 px / 4, where the 4 covers the measured excess of up to 2.2x.
- **Check against frames 431-434:** bounds 2.6e-6, 1.7e-6, 1.1e-6, 6.7e-7 px, so all are refused. Their measured de maxima were 0.50%, 0.36%, 0.09% and 0.11%. Frame 435 bounds at 4.2e-7 px and is admitted.
- **Scope of the rule:** it depends on resolution (at 320x180, frame 433 is admitted). It covers only the first return, since later returns' inputs do not depend on the frame. Not certified (PROB-13).

**max_iter margin rule: none.** mpmath shows the zone's class at the max_iter boundary is right where fd's is wrong (here and in PROB-18). A frame-level exclusion would only hand those pixels back to the wrong side, so admitted frames are scored with class disputes adjudicated. Compared with PROB-18's post-render 2.46x (projected), the frames are now chosen before rendering, and 2.36x is one measured execution.

### PROB-19: the k = 7676 (~1e-1000) rung renders; three-rung table (2026-10-10)

**Measured locally** (Ryzen 9 3900X, 24 threads, 480x270, best of 3 runs per frame, max_iter 40P, nu/de/normal). Command: `THREADS=24 RUNS=3 SIZE=480x270 RUNGS="0 409 7676" FRAMES="5000 500 50 5" bash tools/research/misiurewicz/run_rungs.sh target/release/fd out/prob19`. Same exact centres and widths as PROB-17; every one of 129,600 pixels per frame scored with `fd compare`. The rival is `fd control --bla per-frame`. At v0 and k=409 that is BLA (`bla.use=used`). At k=7676 the scaled tier has no BLA (`bla.use=none`, FIX-03), so it is plain scaled perturbation.

| Rung | Width / minibrot size | Zone build s | Zone frame s | fd frame s | Speed-up | Map returns/px | nu >1e-3 px | Max nu px | Real class errors | FIX-04 pairs |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| v0, P=764 (~4e-50) | 5000 | 11.9 | 0.00768 | 0.162 | 21x | 3.033 | 0 | 2.0e-8 | 0 | 0 |

| v0 | 5 | | 0.01065 | 0.177 | 17x | 9.633 | 0 | 6.2e-8 | 0 | 11904 |
| k=409, P=1582 (~9e-101) | 5000 | 13.7 | 0.00900 | 0.168 | 19x | 4.103 | 0 | 4.0e-6 | 0 | 0 |
| k=409 | 500 | | 0.00843 | 0.182 | 22x | 5.016 | 0 | 1.5e-8 | 0 | 1 |
| k=409 | 50 | | 0.00854 | 0.189 | 22x | 6.071 | 0 | 1.4e-6 | 0 | 120 |
| k=409 | 5 | | 0.01103 | 0.189 | 17x | 10.611 | 0 | 1.7e-7 | 0 | 11902 |
| **k=7676, P=16116 (~1e-1000)** | 5000 | 158.5 | 0.0232 | 22.9 | 990x | 8.002 | 0 | 1.4e-8 | 0 | 0 |
| k=7676 | 500 | | 0.0239 | 25.0 | 1050x | 8.171 | 0 | 1.2e-8 | 0 (1 fd fault) | 0 |
| k=7676 | 50 | | 0.0250 | 27.5 | 1100x | 9.243 | 0 | 9.4e-9 | 0 (1 fd fault) | 118 |
| k=7676 | 5 | | 0.0295 | 42.2 | 1430x | 13.620 | 0 | 1.8e-8 | 0 (1 fd fault) | 11903 |

- **Correctness (DEC-17, nu/class): passes at all three rungs.** Every frame has 0 nu samples over 1e-3 px, 0 non-finite, 0 de over 0.2% and 0 normal over 0.2 deg. The maxima are de 2.8e-4 and normal 0.016 deg, both at k=409.
- **The three k=7676 class disagreements are fd's errors.** They are pixels (184,201), (306,79) and (112,119) in frames 500/50/5: fd says Unresolved, the zone says escaped. 1200-digit mpmath escapes them at n = 145079, 161229 and 209590, and the zone matches within 1e-14 px on nu, 3.3e-8 on de and 0 deg on the normal. Filed as FIX-41 (scaled kernel close-return early-out). **Fixed by FIX-41:** the scaled kernel now ends a sample on a close return only if the orbit contracts over it (the f64 kernel's FIX-02 rule, at most 4 checks). These orbits shadow the weakly repelling M(24,2) 2-cycle and expand, so they keep iterating. Rerun locally (16 threads, 1 run, frames 500/50/5): `fd compare` against the zone gives 0 real class errors in every frame, with FIX-04 pairs unchanged at 0/118/11903. The old and new `fd control` differ on exactly these 3 pixels (Unresolved to escaped) and on no nu value. On the 5-size frame, `fd control` takes about 2% longer (46.9/46.9 s before, 47.5/47.9 s after).
- **FIX-04 pairs** (fd Unresolved, zone Interior) remain and are listed, not waived.
- **Independent check before the run:** 12 spread k=7676 pixels against 1200-digit mpmath. The zone agrees on 10 escapes within 2e-13 px on nu, 5.5e-8 on de and 0 deg on the normal; the other 2 are minibrot interior (mpmath does not escape by max_iter).

**Cost criterion: not met as stated.** The issue keeps the result if zone time per frame grows no faster than the return count. From v0 to k=7676, zone time grows 3.02/3.03/2.85/2.77x at widths 5000/500/50/5, while returns per pixel grow 2.64/2.04/1.93/1.41x. Each return at k=7676 costs 1.15-2.0x a v0 return.

The reason is arithmetic, not more returns. At k=7676 the return-map coefficients reach 2^1666 and the states and entry offset reach 2^-1661, so the deep path computes stage 1 and the Koenigs entry in mantissa + binary exponent. Two changes in this issue cut that path's frame time by about 30%:
- term-wise polynomial sums that align and normalise once;
- lazy-exponent approach and tail steps.

k=409 still runs on the f64 path; its time grows 0.97-1.17x against returns 1.10-1.35x, within the criterion.

**What it means:** a full 1e-1000 minibrot frame costs about 3x a 1e-50 one with the zone, against roughly 130-240x for fd without BLA (0.16 s at v0 vs 23-42 s at k=7676). The 1e-1000 rival has no BLA (FIX-03), so the ~1000x is against the best fd renderer available at that depth, not against a BLA-equipped one.

**Zone file:** `make_zone.sh` writes `biseries_x` and `z24_minus_alpha_x` lines (mantissa pair + binary exponent) next to the f64 lines. `zone.rs` uses the exact lines only when the f64 constants under- or overflow, and refuses a zone with neither (fail closed, DEC-21). Old zone files load unchanged, and on v0 the deep path matches the f64 path within 1e-6 px (unit test).

**Method note (FIX-40):** two separately built fd binaries (shared incremental target vs a fresh `-p fd-cli` build) of the *same source* differed by ~10% in speed. Compare only binaries built the same way, timed interleaved.

### PROB-18: noncontiguous passing frames (2026-10-10)

**Local full-path result (manager, Ryzen 9 3900X, 24 threads, 1280x720, max_iter 1e5):** 314 frames accepted, 5 rejected (431, 432, 742, 747, 748), 431 frames uncovered by the guard. On the accepted frames fd takes 379.4 s and Koenigs 15.9 s (23.8x). Whole film: 611.7 s with fd alone vs 248.3 s with Koenigs on the accepted frames, **2.46x end-to-end measured**. Every accepted frame has 0 wrong pixels, 0 class mismatches beyond FIX-04, and 0 de/normal over tolerance. Max nu displacement 5.1e-4 px.

**mpmath adjudication (diagnose_pixels.py, 180 digits):**
- **431 and 432 (band top, about 1.5e-28): Koenigs fault.** The 82 and 4 disputed samples all escape (mpmath agrees with fd's class). The Koenigs de is off by 0.20–0.36% relative (tolerance 0.2%) and the normal by up to 0.19°; fd's de matches mpmath within 3e-8. The error is shading accuracy near the top of the guard band. A guard starting just below 1.4e-28 would exclude both frames.
- **441:** no disputed samples in the single-frame repro (it passed this run too).
- **742 and 747: fd fault.** fd reports class 2 while Koenigs says escaped. mpmath escapes at n = 99,976–99,981 and 99,901, just under max_iter = 100,000, so Koenigs has the right class. Its de/normal for these near-max-iteration escapes is poor (de rel up to 33, normal up to 153°).
- **748: fd fault.** fd says escaped, while Koenigs and mpmath both say unresolved at 100,000.
- **Conclusion:** the remaining class mismatches are fd errors at the max_iter boundary, not Koenigs errors. The only Koenigs defect is de accuracy at the band top, which a tighter guard removes. Still open: a prospective pre-render guard (DEC-19); acceptance here is decided after rendering.

**Retrospective full-path replay, not a new render.** Recomputed independent
per-frame selection on the complete 750-frame, 1280x720, max_iter=100000,
4-thread [PROB-10 Actions run 38045874904](https://github.com/junovhs/fractodactyl/actions/runs/38045874904)
(artifact: outside.jsonl, times.jsonl, scores.jsonl). All 319 guard-covered
frames were previously scored at every one of 921,600 pixels. The independent
gate accepts **314 frames**, rejecting 431, 432, 742, 747 and 748; the other
431 frames are outside the pre-render guard. Across *every accepted frame*:
**0 wrong nu pixels, 0 other class mismatches beyond FIX-04, 0 nonfinite,
0 de over 0.2%, 0 normal over 0.2°**. The separate fd-Unresolved/zone-Interior
FIX-04 gap is 232,543 samples on accepted frames.

| Full-path replay (same Actions 4-thread runner) | Seconds |
|---|---:|
| fd on all 750 frames | 3302.122 |
| fd on the 314 accepted frames | 2060.809 |
| Koenigs on the 314 accepted frames | 84.286 |
| Estimated fd + accepted Koenigs film | **1325.600** |

End-to-end **2.491x projected** from measured per-frame times, not an
independent execution of the mixed film. On the owner's 24-thread Ryzen,
PROB-10 measured 621.0 s fd-only and 313/319 passing candidates; the new
mixed film timing is still to be measured locally. The gate scores complete
frames *after* rendering; it is not a prospective production guard (DEC-19).

**Six reported failures, all independently gated.** Disposition is from the
180-digit mpmath adjudication above (who is wrong, not who failed):

| Frame | Failure mode beyond FIX-04 | Disposition |
|---:|---|---|
| 431 | 82 de and 1 normal over tolerance (local and Actions) | Koenigs (de 0.20-0.36% at band top; fd matches mpmath) |
| 432 | 4 de over tolerance (local and Actions) | Koenigs (de at band top) |
| 441 | 1 de over locally once; passed Actions and the single-frame repro | none reproduced |
| 742 | 2 fd-Unresolved/zone-Escaped (Actions) | fd (mpmath escapes just under max_iter) |
| 747 | 1 fd-Unresolved/zone-Escaped (Actions) | fd (mpmath escapes just under max_iter) |
| 748 | 1 fd-Escaped/zone-Unresolved (Actions) | fd (mpmath unresolved at max_iter) |

The historical artifact has scores, but not the paired FDS columns identifying
those pixels, so the frames were re-rendered for the adjudication. To repeat it, use the exact per-pixel 180-dps mpmath tool

### PROB-17: conventional zones down the v0 ladder (2026-10-10)

**Measured on GitHub Actions:** [whole-frame run](https://github.com/junovhs/fractodactyl/actions/runs/38052204667), Ubuntu, 4 threads, 480x270, one run per frame, max iteration budget 40P, columns nu/de/normal. For each rung the same exact centre and width were rendered with `fd control --zone` and with fresh `fd control --bla per-frame` (`bla.use=used` at v0 and k=409). Every one of 129,600 pixels/frame was scored using `fd compare`; all frames used the zone. The v0 and k=409 zones have degree-4 biseries, guard 1e-3 of the zone state scale, 12 phi terms, 18 psi terms, and depth-6 tail patches. Zone builds include the whole patch atlas. Times below are one-run frame seconds, **not hardware-independent benchmarks**.

Across all eight 480x270 frames: **0 nu samples over 1e-3 px, 0 nonfinite,
0 de tolerance failures, 0 normal tolerance failures, 0 real class errors**;
FIX-04 Unresolved-vs-Interior pairs remain (24045 total, strictly failing
`fd compare` on six frames). Maximum de relative difference is 2.751e-4
(0.02751%, below the 0.2% tolerance) and maximum normal-angle difference is
0.01648 degrees (below 0.2 degrees). These values score escaped pixels in
both frames, with the usual near-boundary exception for de/normal. FIX-04
pairs are listed separately, not silently waived; the strict whole-frame
class gate remains **unpassed** at widths 500/50/5.

**Cost gate at 1e-100:** at 5000 sizes wide, the k=409/v0 counted-map-return
ratio is 4.103/3.033 = 1.35, and zone-time ratio is 0.035667/0.033418 =
1.07, below the cost-growth limit. At widths 500/50/5, zone-time ratios
are 1.04/0.98/1.03 versus return-count ratios 1.25/1.27/1.10.
Map-return counts exclude the initial orbit period; add one for comparison
with Probe H's steps/P on escaped pixels. At 5000 sizes wide this gives
~4.03 and ~5.10 periods/px, broadly consistent with Probe H's six-point
4.03/4.99. BLA time did **not** grow across these two rungs; the claimed
growth with depth exponent was not established here. This is a positive
speed/correctness probe at 1e-100, **not a three-rung keep result**.

The initial [48x27 diagnostic](https://github.com/junovhs/fractodactyl/actions/runs/38051482894)
failed numerically at k=409 (1230/1210/1026 outliers at widths 5000/50/5):
the generator incorrectly scaled the map by `size * 1e25` rather than
`sqrt(size)`. The corrected state scale plus high-precision map construction
passed the subsequent [48x27 check](https://github.com/junovhs/fractodactyl/actions/runs/38051966768)
with zero nu/de/normal failures; the 480x270 rows above use the correction.
The failed diagnostic is not counted as a result of the final implementation.

**k=7676, P=16116, size ~1e-1000:** the high-precision zone **built in
43.708 seconds** on the same runner (14.6 MB zone file, including 16190
patch leaves; 33.75 s spent generating constants and 8.1 s on patches).
It preserves the nucleus as exact decimal text and the size as mantissa
times binary exponent (~2^-1661). However, `z24_minus_alpha` is ~1e-500
and rounds to zero in the existing Rust zone data structure. The parser
explicitly declines this case instead of producing an invalid jump; a
scaled Koenigs entry/jump is necessary before `--zone` can render any
k=7676 landing. Also, on the scaled tier `fd control --bla per-frame`
has no usable BLA (`bla.use=none`; FIX-03). **No k=7676 frame seconds,
return counts or class/nu/de/normal score can be claimed.** The
logarithmic-growth hypothesis at k=7676 is still open. **Superseded by PROB-19 above:** the k=7676 rung now renders and is scored.

Reproduce on Ryzen 9 3900X (24 threads) from the repo root (Python 3,
mpmath and NumPy installed):

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings

```

The comparison command exits nonzero on the known FIX-04 class mismatches;
the per-frame JSONL and exact class-pair scores are still written.
After a scaled Koenigs jump and scaled-tier BLA become available, rerun
the k=7676 frames with
`THREADS=24 RUNS=3 SIZE=480x270 RUNGS=7676 FRAMES="5000 500 50 5" bash tools/research/misiurewicz/run_rungs.sh target/release/fd out/prob17`.
Before those fixes this fails by design. GitHub Actions passed
`cargo test --workspace`, Clippy with `-D warnings`, shell syntax
and Python compilation. The Actions run reports failure because strict
`fd compare` rejects the documented FIX-04 class pairs.

FACT-01 measurement contract: normalized parameter scale `s_c = 4.1205e-50 * abs(rho)^(-2k)`, state scale `s_z = sqrt(s_c)`; errors are `abs(delta state)/s_z` and `abs(delta (dz/dc))*s_c/s_z`. All deep coordinates and widths stay in mpmath. Cold build includes centre parsing and one 48-term parameter-dependent chart; chart rebuild is timed separately for each of eight pixel parameters; evaluation/direct times are totals for 16 one-return calls. Bytes count decimal-serialized complex coefficients and parameter jets, not Python object heap. Chart entry/output radius <=1e-3, inverse residual and amplified last-eight-term estimate guard evaluations; **this is not a certified bound**. On rejection return a reason and use direct jet iteration as fallback. Only 16 sampled inputs, not whole frames (DEC-17); timing is Python-on-sandbox, not Rust benchmark.

Across those 319 frames Koenigs takes 16.7 s vs fd 393.2 s (23.6x; per-frame 19–30x). 313 frames pass every-pixel: 0 wrong pixels and 0 non-finite values. 6 fail: frames 431, 432, 441 (band top, ~1.5e-28 width) on de over tolerance (82, 4, 1 samples; one normal), and frames 742, 747, 748 (deepest) with 2, 1, 1 class mismatches beyond FIX-04. Max nu displacement 5.1e-4 px. FIX-04 Unresolved→Interior: 367,389 samples, reported separately. The harness's contiguous-deep-suffix rule then accepts only frame 749 (0.25% of the film), so end-to-end it is 1.00x as built. If the 6 failures are fixed (or a per-frame guard abstains on them), the band would cut the film to about 244 s, about 2.5x overall. Follow-ups: the de fault at the band top and the class mismatches at the deepest frames. |

| 2026-10-07 | Does the v0 atlas beat independent frames? (BENC-01) | full benchmark, 750 frames | **No.** It ties per-frame BLA (0.996x). It cached reference and tables worth 18 ms of a 640 ms frame. BENCH.md |

Side findings: (a) BLA builds no usable table on the scaled tier (1e-300 and beyond run 800-2700 plain steps/pixel); (b) inside the period-764 minibrot at 1e-90, every pixel is Unresolved (interior not detected): 48 s plain, 1.75 s with BLA |
| 2026-10-08 | Prior art: cross-frame reuse in zoom videos (deep research, `docs/research/10-8-26/zoom-computation-reuse.md`) | report, plus an analytic check | **Keep: exponential-map strips** (Kalles Fraktaler / Fraktaler 3 export, zoomasm assembly). Each zoom octave is computed once as a log-polar strip of palette-independent samples, and frames are reprojected from it. Rotation and zoom timing are free at assembly time; panning off the fixed centre breaks it. The report's "95-99.9%" compares undersampled strips. At matched sample density the saving is frames-per-octave dependent: **1.8x** on the v0 path (1.97 dec/s, 30 fps), **5.7x** at 0.5 dec/s and 24 fps, **11.3x** at 0.25 dec/s. Its claim that the reference dominates at 1e500 contradicts our measurement (111 ms against a 2.8 s render at 1e-1000). Next: PROB-02 |
| 2026-10-08 | Prior art: return maps near minibrots (deep research, `docs/research/10-8-26/minibrot-renormalization-local-maps.md`) | report | **Keep, needs primary sources.** The idea exists as NanoMB1/NanoMB2 (Heiland-Allen, in Kalles Fraktaler): a per-period bivariate series iterated until escape. BLA's linear validity collapses as the reference passes near 0, about once per period near a minibrot, which is a likely cause of the 32% of pixels with no BLA skip. A map with a quadratic term survives that pass (Douady-Hubbard: the local return map is quadratic-like). The report has no measured speedups and several garbled formulas; read the NanoMB source and blog before designing the probe |
| 2026-10-08 | Prior art: what removes the per-pixel tail beyond perturbation + BLA (deep research, `docs/research/10-8-26/state-of-the-art-beyond-perturbation-bla-for-cpu-deep-zoom-mandelbrot.md`) | report | **Keep, three leads.** (1) Our "no BLA at 1e-300+" is most likely a range bug: BLA coefficients and radii must carry an explicit exponent (Imagina switches to FloatExp below about 2^-896 half-height, roughly where our scaled tier starts); see FIX-03. (2) Deep-minibrot interiors: atom-domain period detection on the reference, Newton nucleus refinement, then per-pixel derivative contraction (about 1e-3, valid only with a nucleus reference; our v0 centre already is one); see FIX-04. (3) The 511-step tail: Imagina's multi-stage LA plus "approximation transformation" (AT; one transformed step equals StepLength raw steps, N' = N/L) is the most direct CPU prior art, then second-order BLA (a 2026 WebGPU implementation reports 21x and 96.9% skipped at 2.8e40, GPU only). All three are per-frame techniques an independent renderer can adopt (the "cheaper frames" question, not "atlas wins"). The report's citations are placeholders, so verify against the Imagina and FractalShark source before porting |

One 0.062-decade ring covers the whole zone at any depth, speed or rotation, and it is inherently cross-frame. The near-minibrot analogue (scale by λ) is **not** a similarity: the body matches but the surrounding decoration hairs do not. `docs/research/10-8-26/misiurewicz-frame-transfer.md` |
| 2026-10-08 | Is the minibrot approach band (1e-25 to 1e-49 on v0) structured like the Misiurewicz zone? | pointwise mpmath, 120-160 random pixels per depth, 1e-30 to 2e-48 | **Keep: decomposition proven exact.** Naive z² map: fails. Per pixel: k returns around the minibrot (ν += 764 each; k = 2-7), then a tail depending only on the exit point ζ through **one fixed dynamical-plane function E_{c0}(ζ)**. 0 class mismatches, max 2.3e-9 px down to 2e-48. Open: a cheap return map (NanoMB/AT) and a sampled E table with an error contract.

Exact 110-dps corner values leave the interpolation failure intact. Correctness-gated scores 0; no wider promotion or atlas-win claim. |

### PROB-03: fixed period-764 biseries (negative result)

The question is **cheaper frames**. A per-frame renderer can build the same map;
this is not an atlas win. Read RESE-02's scope first: its primary-source distillation
is still backlog, so this experiment does not claim to implement Imagina AT or the
full KF NanoMB algorithm. Primary formulation: [Heiland-Allen's deep-zoom write-up](https://mathr.co.uk/blog/2021-05-14_deep_zoom_theory_and_practice.html)
and [KF's NanoMB manual](https://mathr.co.uk/kf/manual.html). Both describe a biseries
in orbit and parameter offsets, repeated for one period at a time, then regular
iteration outside its escape radius. This implementation derives its own coefficients
from the quadratic recurrence; no upstream code was copied.

For reference orbit Z beginning at C, write z=Z+s*u, c=C+s*v, s=1e-25.
Compose `u_next=2*Z*u+s*u*u+v` for 764 steps, truncating total degree after
each step and retaining all mixed terms. Reference and nucleus residual use 110-dps
mpmath; coefficients use NumPy complex128. Start the pixel at z1=C+d and apply the
map once for every original return. The frozen truth fixes the original return
count for this diagnostic: this is not a runnable production exit scheduler.
After those returns, directly iterate the candidate at the actual pixel parameter
(rather than c0) to isolate map error from the separate exit-table hypothesis.

**Validity/error/fallback contract:** original exit radius is 1.7e-15 around C;
the candidate's conservative empirical input guard is 1e-26 for degree >=4.
This guard is sampled, not a certified disk. Error limit is 1e-3 px, both for
smooth-iteration displacement (truth DE divided by w/480) and the local equivalent
parameter displacement `|z_map-z_truth|/|dz_truth/dc|/(w/480)`. Outside-guard
polynomial evaluations are diagnostic only, never accepted. Nonfinite/huge output,
escape inside a raw period, an input outside the guard, class mismatch, or error
above the limit prevents an all-return pass. The unchanged legacy raw-iteration
path remains the fallback. No points are silently removed from the eight-per-depth
denominator. Class checks are Escaped versus Unresolved at 20,000 iterations;
Unresolved is not a proof of interior membership. The frozen fixture is generated
by `--freeze --jobs 18`; normal probes never recompute truth. This is a small
issue-local pack, not completion of TRUT-01 or an independent-oracle promotion.

Highest tested degree (12), original radius; errors below are **unguarded
diagnostics** on finite candidates, including candidates needing fallback:

| Width | Max tail px error | Max local state px error | Class mismatches / evaluated | Fallback / 8 | Map return ops/px | Raw return ops/px |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 1e-35 | no finite candidate | no finite candidate | 0 / 0 | 8 | 2800 | 9168 |
| 1e-38 | 1.35e-12 | 1.12e-12 | 0 / 8 | 0 | 2800 | 9168 |
| 1e-40 | 2.79e-12 | 1.12e-12 | 0 / 7 | 1 | 2975 | 9741 |
| 1e-43 | 13.53 | 4.29e6 | 0 / 6 | 7 | 4200 | 13752 |
| 1e-46 | 3.50e-12 | 1.48e-12 | 0 / 4 | 5 | 5600 | 18336 |
| 2e-48 | 8.42e-11 | 7.63e-11 | 0 / 5 | 7 | 7525 | 24639 |

Build times for degrees 1/2/4/6/8/10/12 were
0.009/0.011/0.032/0.092/0.213/0.477/0.897 s. Map costs per return are
36/90/240/446/708/1026/1400 real arithmetic operations against 4584 for
764 raw squares/adds (complex multiply=6, square=4, add=2).
Per-pixel columns multiply this by the truth's mean number of requested returns;
they are theoretical attempted-map costs, not successful end-to-end costs.
Tail, derivatives, fallback, memory traffic, and build amortization are excluded.
Degree 1 is a local linear-return diagnostic, **not** our hierarchical BLA renderer.
Because every candidate fails correctness/domain coverage, no speedup over BLA
or promotion is claimed; a fair BLA timing is required before any later keep result.

**Handoff:** this finite sweep kills one fixed, low-degree map over the original
return schedule. It does not rule out higher degrees, a smaller exit radius with
raw transition steps, adaptive charts, or multi-stage LA/AT. RESE-02 remains the
prior-art prerequisite for that next experiment. PROB-04 must not assume that all
returns are now cheap. The exit table, Rust kernel and nested chains were not changed.

### PROB-07: tight exits and one fixed-parameter E_C tail

2026-10-07. **Keep the decomposition on the frozen sample.** With the common
1e-26 input guard, degree 4 is the lowest tested degree passing all six depths;
degree 2 fails at 1e-38, 1e-43 and 1e-46, while degrees 6 and 8 also pass everywhere.
All 192 candidate evaluations have zero class mismatches and zero numerical/return-limit
failures. This corrects the overly wide 1.7e-15 exit schedule tested in PROB-03.

Exit 0, 2.494 s including the BLA control. The original 48-point,
110-dps fixture is unchanged. Candidate scheduling starts at z1=C+d, applies a
biseries only while its **input** satisfies |z-C| <= guard, and stops immediately
after an output leaves that domain. It never uses truth's old return count.
At exit zeta, the candidate smooth value is **1+k*764+E_C(zeta)**, where E_C
is directly evaluated at fixed C with a fixed 20,000-step tail budget. No c0 or
pixel parameter is used in that tail. Total escape steps are then checked against
the fixture's 20,000-step horizon. Direct tail evaluation stands in for the future
shared table; there is no table, interpolation, Rust change or promotion here.

**DEC-10 contract:** keep requires both smooth displacement and local equivalent
parameter displacement <=1e-3 px, zero class mismatches and zero failures. The local
exit-state diagnostic runs only an auxiliary exact prefix at the pixel parameter,
at the candidate's exit count, and divides state difference by its d/dc derivative
and w/480. Frozen smooth/class truth is not recomputed. A second control runs E_C
from that exact prefix state: its worst smooth error is 1.45e-11 px with the common
guard, separating map truncation from fixed-C substitution. These are sampled
guards, not certified disks; unsupported inputs and observed errors require raw
fallback in a later implementation. All eight samples per depth stay in the score.

Common input guard 1e-26; every row has class mismatches 0/8:

The remaining direct-tail work is real: 161–849 steps/pixel for the passing
degree-4 cohort. With an actual E_C table it would become one lookup; lookup cost
and interpolation error remain unmeasured. Arithmetic uses PROB-03's model
(complex multiply=6, square=4, add=2), excluding derivatives, guards, memory and
build amortization. Maps cost 90/240/446/708 ops per return at degrees 2/4/6/8;
measured build seconds were 0.012/0.025/0.077/0.192. Worst-depth scores against frozen raw arithmetic,
with lookup unpriced, are 0/21.127/11.369/7.162. They are projections, not measured
speedups.

**Fair opponent (DEC-14):** the existing fd binary runs per-frame BLA on separate
8x4 grids at the same six widths, via `fd control <six-line-path> --size 8x4
--iter 20000 --columns nu,de --threads 18 --bla per-frame --runs 1`.
All 192 grid samples escaped. BLA work is measured, but its grid differs from the
frozen eight points, so this is contextual cost comparison, not a matched-point
speedup. BLA arithmetic is modeled at 14 ops per perturbation fallback or linear
block (2Z*dz+dz^2+dc or A*dz+B*dc), excluding derivative and guard work.
A per-frame rival can build the same biseries. The shared E_C function is the
cross-frame candidate; atlas benefit is still unproven until PROB-04 builds and
prices the table.

| Width | Frozen direct ops/px | BLA raw fallback/px | BLA blocks/px | Modeled BLA ops/px | Degree-4 map ops/px |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

**Exit-radius histogram:** bins are floor(log10(|zeta-C|)); each cell sums to eight.
All four degrees at the common guard have these same bin counts. Their outputs
can overshoot far beyond the input guard: degree-4 exit radii range from
1.249e-26 to 7.648e-5. PROB-04 must cover the actual exit distribution, not assume
it ends at 1e-22. The annuli alone do not determine table size or interpolation error.

| Width | Common 1e-26 guard, degrees 2/4/6/8 (exponent: count) | Smaller degree-2 guard 1e-30 (exponent: count) |
|---|---|---|
| 1e-35 | -22: 3, -21: 5 | -22: 3, -21: 5 |

**Separate smaller-domain quadratic variant:** `--quadratic-guard 1e-30` exits
earlier and passes all six depths (exit 0, 2.519 s). It uses a narrower sampled
guard rather than claiming degree 2 is valid throughout 1e-26. Its worst error is
7.65e-5 px; max fixed-C-only control error is 1.78e-9 px. It trades more tail work
for fewer map operations, and has exit radii 1.441e-30 to 7.648e-13:

| Width | Max smooth px | Max local px | Returns range | Mean direct-tail steps | Projected map ops/px | Verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|

| 2e-48 | 1.064e-7 | 5.349e-8 | 4–5 | 796.5 | 393.8 + lookup | KEEP |

**Handoff:** degree 4 at 1e-26 is the common-domain baseline for PROB-04; the
narrower quadratic variant is a separate viable option. E_C must use **C**, not c0,
through the transition region. The exit samples suggest a wide transition domain
and motivate testing table coverage/interpolation before claiming atlas speed.

### PROB-04: shared exit table, uniform interpolation rejected

Question: **atlas wins**, conditional on a correct shared E_C payload. The probe
builds two actual tables at fixed parameter C, then reuses each across the six
depth cohorts. It stores float64 smooth escape nu and int32 escape step count
per node (12 bytes/node), rather than resume states, de or normal. This measures
only the smooth/class requirement; it cannot establish complete shading accuracy.
The 764-step degree-4 prefix retains the PROB-07 input guard 1e-26.

Representation: explicit log-polar rings centred at C, log10 radius -26 through
-4, periodic angular seam, bilinear interpolation in log radius and angle.
This covers the measured 1.249e-26 to 7.648e-5 exits. No M(24,2) self-similar
wrap is used: transferring E_C across C-c0 without a measured error contract
would add another unsupported approximation. Table nodes use fixed-C
perturbation around a 110-dps reference starting at C; C-relative deltas preserve
the small offsets instead of rounding C+delta to a double.

Validity/fallback (DEC-10): lookups outside log10 radius [-26,-4), non-finite
inputs, unresolved corners, an ambiguous 20,000-step horizon, or a 60-return
prefix limit require direct iteration. No interpolation bound is certified.
The frozen-pack correctness gate rejects an entire configuration if any point
exceeds 1e-3 px, changes escape class or needs fallback. Both tested
configurations are rejected, so their interpolated values must not be used in
production. Every query remains in the denominator; none of the 48 queries
needed domain/horizon fallback and all escaped in both truth and tables.

The report records payload sizes, timings, controls, per-depth errors and sharing.
Reports and BLA output stay outside the worktree. The final run took 4.840 s,
exit 0; the biseries build took about 0.03 s. Timing is host-dependent.
Regression: `--tight-probe --jobs 18 --report <external>/tight-regression.json`
took 2.254 s, exit 0, preserving the degree-4/6/8 passes and degree-2 failures.
`git diff --check` also passed (exit 0).

These are array payload bytes, excluding metadata, the temporary reference and
construction scratch. Both payloads are small against DEC-03's 2.5 GiB target /
3 GiB cap, but neither meets accuracy. No estimate of sufficient table size is
established by these failures; errors do not decrease uniformly with resolution.

Displacement is |nu_predicted-nu_truth| ln(2) de_truth / (width/480).
The deep truth derivative encoded in de accounts for sensitivity through the
returns; interpolated tail derivatives are not substituted into the error metric.
The exact-prefix fixed-C control stays within 1.450e-11 px; the map's local state
error stays within 2.237e-4 px. Direct double-tail controls also pass, with no class
mismatches. Independent 110-dps evaluations replace **all** used corner values:
150 coarse / 152 fine nodes. Maximum node smooth discrepancies are 0.008478 /
4.021e-5, with zero node class or escape-step differences. Re-interpolation from
those exact corners still fails by the values above. This isolates interpolation
as the decisive failure, rather than mistaking a node-evaluation defect for it.

**Measured opponent and timing limits:** `fd control` receives 48 1x1 views,
each centred exactly at the corresponding frozen C+d, same width, 20,000-step
budget, nu/de columns, one thread and per-frame BLA. Pixel-centre sampling makes
these matched coordinates, unlike PROB-07's separate 8x4 grid. Final measured
BLA render cost averages 283.213 us/pixel. Candidate timing is 20 repetitions of
the same predecoded scalar Python degree-4 map + lookup batch, excluding table
build, truth checks and fallback. BLA includes its render/column work; the
candidate computes nu only. Tiny one-pixel views, distinct per-point references
and Python/Rust differences prevent a full-frame speed claim. Score is matched
BLA render time / warm candidate time **only after correctness passes**; both
scores are 0, regardless of the apparent lookup-time advantage. A fair rival can
adopt the same biseries; the table, rather than that map, is the reuse hypothesis.

**Sharing and handoff:** one table serves six depth cohorts, a measured 6:1
frames-per-table ratio on these diagnostic views (48 lookups). Full-v0 frame
coverage and effective accepted sharing are unmeasured; no frame is accepted by
these failed configurations. DEC-14 therefore stops before the >=1,000 points
per depth validation. This satisfies PROB-04's recorded-kill alternative, not its
success alternative. It rejects uniform bilinear nu interpolation at these two
resolutions, not adaptive/derivative-aware tables, resume-state tables, the
return decomposition, or all tables fitting the budget. Next planned work is
PROB-05; another exit-table representation needs its own winning cheap probe.

| 2026-10-08 | Can the exit tail skip its spiral-out along the repelling 2-cycle analytically (Koenigs jump), with no table? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_tail.py tools/research/misiurewicz/return_map_truth.json TERMS R0`; frozen 48-point truth, exact prefix to the PROB-07 1e-26 exit, then a fixed-C tail; about 1 s per configuration | **Keep.** The tail goes 23 direct steps to the 2-cycle point α_C, then φ (Koenigs series of f_C² at α_C, ρ_C) jumps j = ⌊log(R0/\|φ\|)/log\|ρ\|⌋ cycle-steps, then ψ = φ⁻¹ (Newton) and finishes directly. 40 terms with R0 = 1e-3, 1e-2 or 3e-2 is exact against truth (max 6.5e-12 px, 0 class mismatches, all six depths). **12 terms with R0 = 0.03: max 2.6e-8 px; 8 terms: max 2.3e-5 px.** R0 ≥ 0.1 fails (outside the series' useful radius). Tail steps fall from 113-996 to 56-342 (most 56-150); no orbit re-approached α. Replaces the rejected PROB-04 interpolated table for the spiral-out part. It is a per-frame technique ("cheaper frames", DEC-15), not an atlas payload. Open: why some tails still need about 300 steps after the jump; ψ by series reversion instead of Newton; real timing against BLA |
| 2026-10-07 | After the Koenigs jump, why do some tails still need about 300 steps? Is there a second spiral to skip? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_leftover.py tools/research/misiurewicz/return_map_truth.json` (from that directory); same 48 points, 12 terms, R0 = 0.03; under 1 s | **No simple second spiral.** f_C's α fixed point has multiplier −0.9976+0.1314i (\|·\| = 1.0062, very slowly repelling), but the long tails (279 and 319 steps; most others 33-151 after the 23 approach steps) do not spiral out from it monotonically: they wander 0.1-0.5 away from it, through the region shared by the fixed point and the 2-cycle. That is the near-parabolic "seahorse gate" around c = −3/4. A Koenigs series cannot linearise it. Skipping it would need near-parabolic Fatou coordinates (Lavaurs/Douady), a harder construction. It is not attempted here. |
| 2026-10-07 | Can the whole exit tail (approach, Koenigs jump, finish) run in plain IEEE double? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_double.py tools/research/misiurewicz/return_map_truth.json TERMS R0` (from that directory); exact mpmath loop prefix, then the exit point is passed as the double offset δ = ζ − C; 23 approach steps are double perturbation against C's critical orbit, h0 = (Z_24 − α) + δ_24; φ is Horner in double, ψ is Newton in double, the finish is plain double; about 1 s | **Keep.** Matches the 80-digit tail: 40 terms, R0 = 0.03: max 1.2e-10 px. 12 terms, R0 = 0.03: max 2.65e-8 px. 12 terms, R0 = 0.01: 1.3e-10 px. 8 terms, R0 = 0.03: 2.3e-5 px. 6 terms, R0 = 0.01: 3.3e-6 px. 0 wrong pixels on all six depths; tail steps 56-342, as before. Rounding ζ itself to double fails (ζ − C is 1e-26 to 1e-5), so the offset form is required. Two script bugs were caught before logging: ζ was rounded directly (fixed by the offset form), and an off-by-one in ν (exactly 1.0 ν, 3-64 px). The tail is therefore cheap hardware arithmetic (one complex square-add per step plus about 100 flops for the jump). Still open: the loop prefix in double/FloatExp, and real timing against per-frame BLA. |
| 2026-10-07 | Can the whole deep pixel (loops + tail) run in IEEE double with no per-pixel multiprecision? Which loop degree/guard is cheapest? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_double_full.py tools/research/misiurewicz/return_map_truth.json DEGREE 12 0.03 [GUARD]` (from that directory); per pixel only v = (c−C)/1e-25 is rounded from high precision; biseries coefficients come from `returns_exit_tail.build_map` (double); tail from `koenigs_double`; under 1 s | **Keep.** Degree 4 with guard 1e-26: max 2.17e-4 px, 0 wrong pixels, identical to the 80-digit PROB-07 result. Guard sweep (max px / wrong pixels > 1e-3): 1e-26 → degree 2 1.55 / 11, degree 3 2.9e-2 / 4, degree 4 2.2e-4 / 0. 1e-28 → degree 2 9.2e-5 / 0, degree 3 1.75e-6 / 0, degree 4 1.75e-6 / 0. 1e-30 → 6.1e-3 / 1 for every degree. 1e-32 → 7.9 / 7 for every degree. Guards ≤ 1e-30 fail independently of degree: the fixed-C tail ignores c − C, which matters when the exit offset is too small (the expected PROB-07 lower bound, not a precision bug). Cheapest passing loop: degree 2 (5 terms) at guard 1e-28; degree 3 at 1e-28 has more margin. 8 points per depth only. Next: real timing in Rust against per-frame BLA. |
| 2026-10-07 | PROB-08: real timing. Is the all-double deep-pixel pipeline (biseries loops + Koenigs tail) faster than per-frame BLA on whole frames, with every pixel correct? | `bash tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_bench/run.sh target/release/fd OUT` (Rust bench, 480x270, 4 threads, best of 2-3 runs, six frames centred at C from 1e-35 to 2e-48, max_iter 20,000); manual CI: `gh workflow run koenigs-bench.yml` | **Keep (local, Windows, 20-core host).** Degree 4, guard 1e-28, 12 φ terms, R0 0.03, scored against `fd control --bla per-frame` on all 777,600 pixels: 0 wrong pixels (> 1e-3 px), 0 class mismatches, max 3.2e-4 px. The worst pixels were checked against 90-digit direct iteration: fd is exact (≤ 1e-11 px), so all residual error is the candidate's. Frame seconds, fd BLA / lean perturbation / Koenigs: 1e-35 0.327/0.505/0.033 (9.9x vs fd); 1e-38 0.551/0.577/0.048 (11.4x); 1e-40 0.923/0.673/0.036 (25.9x); 1e-43 0.482/0.802/0.044 (11.0x); 1e-46 0.497/1.080/0.044 (11.2x); 2e-48 0.569/1.457/0.040 (14.1x). Against the lean perturbation baseline (same Rust file, so the comparison isn't distorted by code quality): 12-36x. That baseline is slower than fd, so fd is not a bloated opponent. Candidate time is flat with depth; both opponents grow. **Full-frame kills:** degree 4 at guard 1e-26 (32-178 wrong pixels per frame, up to 0.14 px, which the 48-point probe missed); degree 2 at 1e-28 (up to 4,720 wrong, 0.5 px, though it passed 48 points); 1e-29 (up to 4 wrong). Degree 3 at 1e-28 also passes. Scope: frames inside the minibrot band centred at the zone nucleus; shallower frames (pixels farther than the guard from C) need another method. Constants are per zone (built once in Python in about 0.1 s) and shared by every frame. This is per-frame speed ("cheaper frames", DEC-15), adoptable by any renderer that knows the zone. |

| 2026-10-07 | Deep-research report: can the near-parabolic "seahorse gate" leftovers be skipped? (`docs/research/10-8-26/skipping-near-parabolic-transits-what-is-computable.md`) | Literature (Kapiamba, Lanford–Yampolsky, Petersen–Zakeri, Braverman) | **Lead, untested.** Exact skips exist: Kapiamba's q = 2 near-parabolic identity g^(2n+k) = χ∘T_(n−1/α_NP)∘ρ, and Koenigs at the weak α fixed point (\|λ\| = 1.00622). The report computes the canonical gate width as only about 22 raw iterations (1/α_NP ≈ 11.47 − 0.57i). It argues the hundreds of leftover steps are weak-repelling dwell near α, best skipped by a second Koenigs jump at α, with Buff coordinates (three logs plus an analytic correction) as a cheap gate model and Braverman long-iterates as a rigorous fallback. No published renderer uses Fatou/Lavaurs/horn maps per pixel. Caveat from our koenigs_leftover diagnostic: the long tails stay 0.1-0.5 from α without monotone spiralling, so they may be repeated gate passes rather than one dwell. Next cheap probe: count gate passes per long tail, and fit a Koenigs series at α (residual vs radius). |

That is ≤0.005% of pixels, all under 0.005 px, invisible but over the 1e-3 bar; the worst depth is 1e-38. At 480x270: degree 3 / 1e-28 PASS (max 3.2e-4); degree 4 / 1e-27 PASS with smaller errors at most depths (max 7.4e-4); degree 3 / 1e-27 FAIL (up to 399 wrong, 0.098 px). More pixels expose rarer errors, as DEC-17 predicts. Next: find which stage causes the rare 1e-3 to 5e-3 px pixels (loop truncation, fixed-C tail, or Koenigs terms), re-run 1920x1080 with the fix, and give run.sh a TERMS input. |

A Koenigs jump at α could save at most about 5% of tail steps, so it was not built. **Profile (new `koenigs-loops`/`koenigs-jump` stage-cutoff modes):** the loops take 3-9 ms per 480x270 frame, the approach + jump about 80 ms (60% of the pixel), and the tail 30-80 ms. The jump's Newton ψ averages 8.6 iterations, and 12% of pixels hit the 30-iteration cap because the 1e-16 stop test is at double roundoff. |

They are ill-conditioned measurement points, not errors in either renderer. Our pipeline vs fd on the same runner: CORRECTNESS PASS. |
| 2026-10-07 | BENC-04 at 1920x1080: does the lead over fraktaler-3 hold at full HD, where its 0.07 s process start-up is negligible? | `f3_bench.sh` via f3-bench.yml, run 37689189967 (windows-latest, 4 cores, best of 2) | **Yes: ours is 22-28x faster than fraktaler-3.** Seconds per frame, fraktaler-3 / fd per-frame BLA / ours: 1e-35 12.04/10.63/0.455 (26.5x); 1e-38 14.03/16.83/0.626 (22.4x); 1e-40 12.70/26.62/0.447 (28.4x); 1e-43 12.95/13.78/0.532 (24.3x); 1e-46 13.25/15.26/0.550 (24.1x); 2e-48 13.84/15.86/0.556 (24.9x). Our pipeline vs fd on the same runner: CORRECTNESS PASS, 0 wrong of 12.4M pixels, max 1.7e-4 px.

With the true DE, both renderers' displacement errors there are negligible (fraktaler-3 ≤ 4.2e-6 px, ours ≤ 1.6e-7 px); the large values come only from fraktaler-3's DE, which is wrong by orders of magnitude at such points.

| 2026-10-07 | PROB-12 seed test: is the v0 zone special? How much of a minibrot's nucleus orbit circles one repelling cycle (the part a Koenigs jump skips)? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/zone_seed.py 20 1` (about 20 s: the v0 centre, the classic valley centre, 20 random near-boundary points; atom-domain period → nucleus Newton at 120 digits → longest run where the orbit repeats after r steps while repelling, for every r < p/2) | **v0 is the strong case; random minibrots are not.** v0: p 764, 683 steps (89%) within 1e-2 of the 2-cycle from step 24 = **341 laps** (\|λ\| 1.153); D-ranking also recovers q 24, r 2, distance 1.71e-25. Other minibrots (p 37-1601): the longest repeat runs are 0-503 steps, but only 0-4.7 laps of the cycle (best rnd13: 503 steps of a 108-cycle; valley 503 of 429; most < 2 laps). With r ≤ 8 only, every random case had 0 dwell. Reading: laps ≈ ln(minibrot size / distance to the Misiurewicz point)/ln\|λ\|, so the fast path pays off for minibrots parked near a spiral centre (as v0 was chosen, and as spiral-following art zooms do), not for arbitrary minibrots. The D-ranking picks spurious (q ≈ p/2, \|λ\| < 1) relations at random minibrots; the dwell/lap measure is the robust one. Next (PROB-12): measure laps band by band along real zoom paths. |
| 2026-10-07 | PROB-12 seed test: along whole zoom paths, which depth bands have the v0 structure? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/path_laps.py NAME RE IM -48` (2.1 s for both paths: per 3-decade band, the lowest-period minibrot in view, i.e. smallest p with \|z_p/u_p\| < width; 150-digit Newton; laps = longest repelling-cycle repeat run / r) | **The v0 path has it at every depth from 1e-6 down.** Width → period, laps around the 2-cycle, skippable share: 1e-6 → 143, 40, 55%; 1e-9 → 241, 89, 73%; 1e-12 → 337, 137, 81%; 1e-15 → 435, 186, 85%; 1e-18 → 531, 234, 88%; 1e-21 → 627, 282, 90%; 1e-24 → 731, 332, 91%; 1e-27 to 1e-48 → 764, 342, 89%. Every band's minibrot circles the same r = 2 cycle (M(24,2)), with period growing about 96 per band. So the Koenigs series and the tail patch atlas (per 2-cycle) could serve 45 of the film's 49 decades from one build, with only the minibrot loop map changing per band (PROB-08/09 tested 1e-35 to 2e-48 only). **The classic valley path** (`bench/path-valley.txt` centre, 36 digits): p 35, 78 (0 laps), then p 998 with 1.2 laps from 1e-9 to 1e-15; no minibrot below p 5,000 deeper. It is not aimed at a spiral centre and would gain little. |

The band's own nucleus is no better than C764 (the frame's pixels span the width either way). With the correction: 1e-15 T 300 → 1.2e-6 px (0 of 16 over 1e-3); T ≥ 600 still fails (non-escaping or wrong orbits); 1e-9 fails at every T. Reading: from about 1e-15 down, one tail plus a dF/dc derivative patch per atlas leaf is plausible if the tails there are ≲300 steps (to check); shallower bands need per-band tails or plain BLA, and are cheap anyway. These probes are slow (mpmath); write the next ones in double. |

In the 1e-15 and 1e-24 bands most pixels make no close return at all: they escape within about one period. This corrects FIX-23's "one build could serve 45 of 49 decades". Mid bands need parameter-dependent tails beyond first order (a real research item), or BLA. |

Over 2M steps, 94% of the orbit is 11.5 laps of the centre's own period-159,413 minibrot: the minibrot-loop structure NanoMB already exploits (and our loop map does), not the new spiral jump. Within one minibrot period, repelling short-cycle dwells of ≥ 4 laps cover 24.3% (largest: r 197 for 18.6 laps at \|λ\| 3.3; r 655 for 4.3 laps at \|λ\| 9.5, recurring). Reading: on zoom-doubling dives into nested minibrots the main skip is minibrot loops (prior art), and the Koenigs jump adds at most about 1.3x; the large new win is on spiral-centre dives like v0 (89% of steps, 341 laps). |
| 2026-10-07 | BENC-08 seed test: can the deep pipeline run in single precision (GPU speed)? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/single_precision.py CONSTS FD_REF` (numpy reimplementation of the koenigs_bench pixel pipeline with a precision switch per stage, scored on all pixels of the six 480x270 PROB-08 frames against fd per-frame BLA; about 0.3-1 s per frame and variant) | **Not as-is, but most of it can be float32, and what must stay float64 is small.** Wrong px (> 1e-3) per frame, 1e-35 / 1e-38 / 1e-40 / 1e-43 / 1e-46 / 2e-48: A all f64 (sanity): 0/0/0 (= Rust bench). B all f32: 20,088 / - / 826 / - / - / 122,893 (median 150 px at 2e-48): fails. F f32 front, f64 finish: same as B, so the front end is the problem. G f32 with f64 glue (h0 = Z24-α + d, φ, log/arg, t): 104 / 17,856 / 53 / 929 / 123,704 / 122,896: the pixel offset (~1e-28) added to a ~1e-23 constant wiped it out in f32. L f64 loops + approach + glue, f32 patch polynomial and finish: 24 / 17,908 / 4 / 885 / 3,161 / 5,202 (median 1e-7 to 2e-4 px): the minibrot loop map needs f64 (its ~1e24-scale terms cancel near the minibrot). P all f64 except the f32 finish: 22 / 16,980 / 4 / 824 / 2,960 / 4,915, about the same as L, so the patch polynomial is fine in f32 and the remaining errors come from the plain escape steps. R as L with the finish as f32 offsets from a per-patch f64 reference orbit: worse (9,860-35,556 wrong; patch centres are too far from their pixels). Reading: float32 is safe for the patch polynomial; the loops (2-5 per pixel), the glue (a few ops) and the escape steps (median 2, long tail) need f64. That is roughly 600 f64 flops per pixel (estimate), so even a 1/64-rate consumer GPU is plausible. Measure it, don't assume it (BENC-08). |
| 2026-10-07 | BENC-08 GPU test: the deep pipeline as an OpenCL kernel on the owner's laptop GPU (RTX 3050 Ti Laptop, 4 GB, consumer NVIDIA with 1/64-rate float64) | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/koenigs_bench/gpu_bench.py CONSTS OUT 1920x1080 5 WIDTHS` (pyopencl, same stages as the Rust bench; PATCH32=1 evaluates the tail patch in float32); scored with compare.py against local `fd control --bla per-frame` 1080p frames | **Correct, and modestly faster than the CPU here.** float64 kernel vs fd: CORRECTNESS PASS at 480x270 (max 2.5e-6 px) and 1920x1080 (0 wrong of 12.4M, max 1.6e-4 px). 1080p ms per frame, GPU float64 / our CPU bench at 20 threads: 1e-35 88/111; 1e-38 103/178; 1e-40 82/127; 1e-43 113/137; 1e-46 119/158; 2e-48 131/152 (1.2-1.7x). fd per-frame BLA on the same laptop: 22.9 s for the six 1080p frames (about 3.8 s each), so the GPU kernel is about 35x faster than fd here. float32 patch (PATCH32): barely faster (79-129 ms) and **fails at 1080p** (7 to 274,523 wrong px, max 3.5 px). This corrects FIX-27: the patch is float32-safe only at 480x270, so the kernel must be all float64. Consumer AMD GPUs usually have a much higher float64 rate relative to float32; the same OpenCL code runs there (DEVICE=AMD). |
| 2026-10-07 | Two quick seeds. (1) Free CPU speed from `-C target-cpu=native`? (2) Do higher-order parameter corrections let the 1e-15 band share the fixed-parameter tail? | (1) koenigs_bench built with and without `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-cpu=native"`, 1920x1080, 20 threads, 6 PROB-08 frames, best of 3, twice. (2) `python tools/research/misiurewicz/shared_tail.py 10 order`: tail at C764 plus Taylor corrections in e = c − C up to order K (d_k recurrences), T 465/700/1000 steps before escape, 10 pixels, 60-digit truth (23 s) | **(1) No gain:** 80-117 ms (default) vs 81-121 ms (native), since scalar complex code is not auto-vectorised. Explicit 4-pixel SIMD is a restructure, not a quick win. **(2) Kill:** at 1e-15 (median escape 481 steps), max px error with K = 1/2/3/4 is ∞ / 1.7e4 / 1.1e4 / 8.3e3, with 8-10 of 10 pixels wrong at every T. The shared parameter's orbit is periodic (a nucleus) while the pixels escape, and a parameter series cannot bridge that over the frame's spread. The fixed-parameter fast path is a deep-band technique; mid bands stay on BLA unless a different construction is found (owner's deep-research question on transfer maps from accelerator physics and astrodynamics). |
| 2026-10-08 | How much of a whole v0 film does the deep fast path speed up? And what does the parameter-transfer deep-research report change? | `bench/benc-01-results.json` depth bins (arm B, per-frame BLA, 960x540): seconds per frame × frames per bin; owner-run report `docs/research/10-8-26/parameter-dependant-transfer-maps-rendering.md` | **About 2.3x on the whole v0 film, today.** Frames 450-750 (width ≤ 1e-29, the fast-path band) take 284 of 478 s (59%); at 20x on the band the film takes 1/(0.41 + 0.59/20) ≈ 2.3x less time (2.4x at 50x). Bins 1e-9 to 1e-29 are another 176 s (37%). With the path_laps skippable shares (73-91%) as caps, covering them would give roughly 8x on the film (an estimate, not measured). **Report:** the failed c ≠ C corrections (K 1-4 at 1e-15) used one monolithic δ-series through the 2-cycle spiral, which amplifies δ geometrically, so the report's literature (domain splitting beats higher order) explains the kill. Its main idea is a parameter-dependent Poincaré chart: λ(c) = 4(c+1) exactly (it reproduces ρ = 1.02683+0.52496i at C), and F_c^m(L_c(w)) = L_c(λ(c)^m w). This is filed as PROB-14 together with the already-passing first-order corrected short tail (T 300). Its direct bivariate patches amount to higher-order BLA (ACC-03); its Taylor-model remainder r' ≤ 2Br + r² + τ goes to PROB-13. |
| 2026-10-08 | KERN-01: the PROB-09 pipeline inside fd (`fd control --zone`), on the real v0 film, on the owner's desktop (Ryzen 9 3900X, 24 threads) | `make_zone.sh data/zones/v0.zone` (14 s); `fd control bench/path-atlas-v0.txt --size 960x540 --iter 100000 --columns nu,de,normal --threads 24 --bla per-frame [--zone v0.zone]`; covered band (frames 431-749, width ≤ 1.71e-28) written both ways and scored with `fd compare`; 6 PROB-08 frames at 1920x1080 | **Keep.** Whole film: per-frame BLA 395.9 s → with --zone 158.6 s (**2.5x**); frames 0-430 unchanged (146 s / 148 s); the 319 band frames 249.8 s → 10.4 s (**24.1x**). 1080p, 6 PROB-08 frames: 18.1 s → 0.80 s (22.6x). Band scoring, 165.4M samples: 0 samples over 1e-3 px (max 1.3e-4 px); 0 escaped/interior disagreements; 1 sample fd escapes at n 99,862 (de 1e-12 px) that the zone leaves Unresolved (it will not start a return that could cross max_iter); 100,123 samples fd leaves Unresolved are classed Interior by the zone's return-map test (fd cannot detect this interior, FIX-04; the escaped sets are identical at 200k iterations). de/normal (1080p): on samples with de > 1e-3 px, de within 0.14% and normals within 0.11°; larger differences only within 1e-3 px of the boundary (ill-conditioned, as in BENC-04). Interior test after adding the q ≤ 4 attracting-cycle Newton check: unresolved at frame 749 fell from 34,002 to 6,129 of 518,400 (left: the minibrot's near-parabolic rim, unresolved in fd too). |
| 2026-10-09 | Does any result in OpenAI's 2026-10-06 math release (openai/math, 372 result families, 719 manuscripts) help fd? And the one testable lead: does a triangular (hex) sample lattice beat the square `--ss` grid at equal samples per pixel (their result 090, universal optimality of the triangular lattice)? | All 372 result statements read; full TeX source of every manuscript searched for about 100 technique terms (Koenigs, Fatou coordinate, parabolic, holomorphic motion, Böttcher, Julia, interval arithmetic, sampling, ...). Probe: `python tools/research/sampling/hex_sample_lattice_probe.py 0.5` (numpy only, about 3 min, not fd): plain double iteration, 320x180, three shallow views (seahorse 4e-3 and 2.5e-5, elephant 1e-3), banded shading at two band densities, Gaussian reconstruction (sigma 0.5 px), scored as RMS shaded-value error against a 100-samples-per-pixel truth, 3 lattice offsets each | **No, and the hex lattice is killed.** RMS error relative to square 4 spp (`--ss 2`): hex 4 spp 0.99-1.01x; jittered 4 spp 1.04-1.07x; hex 3.46 spp (13% fewer samples) 1.07-1.08x; hex 3 spp 1.16-1.17x; square 3.06 spp 1.15-1.17x. Sample arrangement is not a lever: error follows sample count, and the regular grid is already as good as hex and better than jitter. Rest of the release: no manuscript treats z²+c, linearisation, near-parabolic transit or holomorphic motions (the "Mandelbrot" and "Misiurewicz" hits are bibliography entries). Multiplication and Fourier results (109, 130, 107) are dead: the reference is at most 4% of a frame (row 2 above) and the savings are asymptotic only. Crouzeix (325) gives nothing for loops of at most 7 scalar returns; Brennan (072) adds nothing to the per-sample de column. One small keep: 090's verification layout (python-flint Arb checker bound to a manifest) as a template for PROB-13 zone certificates. Limits: shallow views in numpy, not fd and not deep frames. |
| 2026-10-09 | PROB-14 probe A/B: does a Koenigs jump at each pixel's own c (2-cycle in closed form, λ(c) = 4(c+1)) cover the mid bands, where the frozen-C tail failed? And does the owner-run explicit-radius theorem (`docs/research/10-9-26/explicit-radius-parameter-dependent-koenigs-2-cycle.md`) give a usable jump radius? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/own_c_koenigs.py 250 18 0.03` (mpmath, 70 digits, 2 min): 250 random pixels per width in a 1920x1080 frame at the v0 centre; exact steps to the first close pass of the 2-cycle (step 24), K_c series (18 terms) built at the pixel's c, jump to \|w\| ≤ 0.03, plain steps to escape; error \|Δν\|·ln2·de in px against direct iteration. Three arms: own-c jump + own-c finish; own-c jump + finish at C; jump and finish at C (control) | **Keep (sampled, not whole frames, not double, not timed).** Own-c jump + own-c finish: 0 of 250 over 1e-3 px at every width, max 5e-13 px. Truth steps (median) → steps left: 1e-6 172 → 66; 1e-9 268 → 65; 1e-12 365 → 63; 1e-15 463 → 66; 1e-18 558 → 65; 1e-24 747 → 62 (24 approach + about 40 finish), so the remaining work is flat with depth. Finish at C instead of c: max px 2.7e-1 at 1e-6 (220 of 250 fail), 1.8e-4 at 1e-9, 7.9e-8 at 1e-12, 1.2e-10 at 1e-15, noise below: a shared fixed-C finish (the tail patch atlas) reaches up to about 1e-9. Control (everything at C): 243-249 of 250 fail at every width, which is the PROB-12 shared-tail failure. No minibrot loop map is needed in these bands (pixels escape within one period). Theorem: consistent with the v0 numbers but its certified radius is about 1e-4 against the working 0.03 (about 80 more plain steps per pixel if obeyed); fallback proof only. **Not yet shown:** double precision (u0 = z − p(c) must come from perturbation deltas), cost of building K_c per pixel or per block, whole frames (DEC-17), and timing against `fd --bla per-frame`. |
| 2026-10-09 | PROB-14 probe C: does the mid-band pixel work in IEEE doubles with ONE set of jump constants per zone (the per-pixel series rebuild of probe A was too slow)? And do the numbers in the owner-run answer `docs/research/10-9-26/parameter-taylor-truncation-of-the-koenigs-coefficients.md` hold on v0? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/shared_consts_double.py 250 18 0.03` (19 s). Zone constants built once at 70 digits and stored as doubles: C's first 24 orbit points, U0 = Z_24 − p(C), √(−3−4C), k_n(C) and dk_n/dc (central difference; the answer's recursion (4) is the production form). Per pixel, doubles only, from dc = c − C: 24 perturbation steps, closed-form cycle shift p(c) − p(C), u0 = U0 + δ − Δp, 3 Newton steps for w0, jump by exp(j·(log λ0 + log1p(4dc/λ0))) to \|w\| ≤ 0.03, one 18-term Horner, plain steps at c. 250 random pixels per width, error \|Δν\|·ln2·de in px (1920-px frame) against 70-digit direct iteration | **Keep (sampled; not whole frames, not timed).** First-order k with exact λ(c): 0 of 250 over 1e-3 px at every width; max px 1.8e-9 (1e-6), 2.7e-11 (1e-9), 5.0e-11 (1e-12), 5.0e-11 (1e-15), 4.5e-11 (1e-18), 7.4e-11 (1e-24); about 64 steps left at every width (24 approach + about 40 finish). Frozen k with exact λ(c): 2 of 250 fail at 1e-6 (max 1.6e-3), passes from 1e-9 down (8.4e-7). Frozen k and frozen λ: 240 of 250 fail at 1e-6, passes from 1e-9 down (7.1e-4 at 1e-9, 5.6e-7 at 1e-12). So measuring the offset from the pixel's own cycle point p(c) is what fixed the PROB-12 shared-tail failure; exact λ(c) and the first-order coefficients are needed only above about 1e-9. Answer check: its first-order Taylor error bounds (≤ 1.92e-19 at r 1e-9, ≤ 1.92e-25 at r 1e-12) match the measured 1.9e-19 and 1.9e-25; frozen coefficients give 3.2e-11 and 3.2e-14. **Not yet shown:** whole frames (DEC-17), timing against `fd --bla per-frame`, the de and normal columns, and handover to the deep path where minibrot returns begin (about 1e-27). |
| 2026-10-09 | PROB-14 probe D: can dz/dc be carried through the Koenigs jump in doubles, so the mid-band fast path produces the de and normal columns? (owner-run answer: `docs/research/10-9-26/derivative-through-the-koenigs-jump.md`) | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/jump_derivative_double.py 250` (19 s). Same zone constants and per-pixel doubles as probe C, plus D0 from the derivative recurrence over the 24 approach steps, the jump derivative, and the recurrence over the finish. Scored on g = z/(dz/dc) at escape (de = 2\|g\|ln\|z\|, normal = arg g) as \|g/g_truth − 1\| against 70-digit direct iteration; 250 random pixels per width. Three arms: formula (2) of the answer; its short form (8) dZ = p′ + λ^j K′(q)(D0 − p′); derivative riding through (dZ = λ^j K′(q) D0) | **Keep formula (2); the ride-through is wrong by a constant 2.7%.** On pixels at least 0.01 px from the set (232-239 of 250 per width), max error: formula (2) 5.3e-8 (1e-6), 3.5e-10 (1e-9), 6.7e-10 (1e-12), 5.2e-10 (1e-15), 1.1e-9 (1e-18), 3.3e-10 (1e-24). Short form (8): 3.1e-4 at 1e-6 (fails, H′(u0) ≠ 1), 3.6e-7 at 1e-9, then equal to (2). Ride-through: 2.7e-2 at every width, the answer's predicted cycle-point term (T_p/T_D = 2.68e-2); ν does not see it, only de and normal do. Pixels closer than about 1e-7 px to the set reach 1e-3 to 2e-2 with every arm (worst 2.2e-2 at de 2.8e-10 px): double position noise over a vanishing de, not the jump. **Not yet shown:** whole frames, timing, fd's own de/normal on the same pixels as the fair comparison for the near-set outliers. |

"Eye of the Universe" centre orbit, 30,000 steps at 1,191 digits; longest dwell per period (\|z_{n+r} − z_n\| < 1e-3); cycle by Newton on f^r; a_m by truncated composition around the cycle; k_n by the Schröder recurrence; all at 90 digits. Jumped point p + K_N(λ^j w0) against the true orbit at each lap, pass = relative error under 1e-10 | **Mixed: the recurrences are exact, the usable radius is small.** r = 655 (dwell 9249..12059, 4.3 laps, \|λ\| 9.51, entry offset 6.6e-12): one jump covers 3 laps at N 8, 4 at N 16, 5 at N 32 (3,275 steps, out to \|u\| 4.5e-5), error 3e-71 on the inner laps; the whole dwell is skippable. r = 197 (dwell 15786..16902, 5.7 laps, \|λ\| 5.78, entry offset 5.6e-8): 2 of 5.7 laps at every N up to 32 (error 2e-29 at lap 2, 5e-5 at lap 3). Coefficient growth \|a_m\|^(1/(m−1)) up to 2.2e7 and 3.6e9, \|k_n\|^(1/(n−1)) up to 8.1e5 and 3.7e7, so the linear regime is about 1e-6 and 3e-8 wide. Both periods are record returns of this orbit: the cycles sit beside nested minibrots and each lap passes near the critical point. So the "24% in repelling-cycle dwells" of the 2026-10-07 Eye row is mostly nested-minibrot looping: inner laps are exact Koenigs, outer laps need the return-map (biseries) tool. Build 0.1-3 s per cycle. **Not shown:** pixels, doubles (coefficients need rescaling), the phase-transported linearizers, timing, any other location. |

The probe C pipeline with each stage's arithmetic forced to float32/complex64 in turn (numpy scalars); the jump either as exp(j·log λ) or from a table of λ0^j built at 70 digits; 250 random pixels at 1e-9, 1e-15, 1e-24; error \|Δν\|·ln2·de in px against 70-digit iteration | **An all-float pixel misses the 1e-3 px bar; a mixed one passes; the finish has to stay double.** Max px (worst width) / pixels over 1e-3: all double 6.6e-11 / 0; stages 1-4 float 6.9e-4 / 0; jump as float exp 3.8e-1 / 181-233; jump from float table 3.9e-4 / 0; float Horner with double add 3.9e-4 / 0; float Horner with float add 5.8e-2 / 44-59; finish in float 9.3e-2 / 135-152; mix (float stages 1-6 with table, double add and finish) 4.2e-3 / 0-2; all float 9.3e-2 / 134-153 (median 1.2e-3; over 1e-2: 0-4 of 250). The answer's stage verdicts match: naive float phase fails, the table fixes it, the float landing add costs about 2e-3 px, and the finish roundoff is amplified about 13x by the weak cycle. The finish is about 40 of the 64 remaining steps, so under the 1e-3 bar most work stays in double; an all-float kernel is a 1e-2 px-class renderer with rare pixels near 0.1 px. **Not shown:** GPU timing of float against double for this kernel, float-float arithmetic for the finish, whole frames. |

| 2026-10-09 | Probe H: is the per-pixel return count flat down a ladder, or does it grow like log2(n) as the owner-run answer `docs/research/10-9-26/universal-landing-claims-a-to-e.md` (eq. B3) says? | `python tools/research/misiurewicz/ladder_bridge.py` (105 s): direct iteration of 6 pixels at the same relative positions in a frame 5,000 minibrot sizes wide, at the v0 rung and at rungs k = 409 and 7676 of its ladder; periods before escape = steps / period | **It grows like log2(n), as predicted.** Periods before escape: v0 (period 764, n 369) 3.88-4.17, mean 4.03; k 409 (period 1,582, n 778, size 9e-101) 4.88-5.18, mean 4.99, change +0.96 against log2(n/n0) = +1.08; k 7676 (period 16,116, n 8,045, size 1e-1000) 8.23-8.56, mean 8.36, change +4.32 against +4.45. So a 1e-1000 destination costs about four more minibrot returns per pixel than v0: logarithmic in the depth exponent, not flat. The answer also rejects the one-lookup "universal landing" formula (the quadratic regime and the linearised regime do not overlap; the last returns need the true return map) and confirms fd's loops + approach + jump + finish as the exact decomposition. Only 6 pixels, one frame width, direct iteration; not the fast path. |

### AUTO-01: guarded automatic finite-cycle compiler (2026-10-10)

Scope: isolated research CLI, branched from main; not `fd --zone`. Base
is `research/auto-misiurewicz-discovery`'s discoverer and native executor.
The earlier 960x540 3-run medians (unguarded, original branch) were **1.4346x**
(c=i) and **1.1677x** (q=3,p=2), with zero class or 1e-3 px failures;
these are *not* evidence for the changed AUTO-01 operator.

**Coordinates (DEC-21):** exact decimal camera centre and width are retained
as strings. The compiler obtains a high-precision reference orbit and cycle
at that exact centre; the native model stores a normalized complex
`bias = z_q - s`, normalized pixel spacing `h_m * 2^h_e`, and the exact
centre metadata. Both prefix and tail iterate reference/phase plus offsets;
no `c0+dc` in f64. A Rust test checks a centre with 1e-400 magnitude and
nonzero sub-f64 offset; another checks a 2^3500 jump multiplier.

**Shortcut guards (DEC-10 and DEC-19):**

| Guard | Rule, fallback | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| State (inverse Koenigs) | `|u|<r/4`, convergent Newton residual, `j>=2`, `|w_out|<=r/2`, finite values and room before max_iter; else phase-reference perturbation | Empirical conservative chart disk; not a certified remainder bound. |
| Parameter | `|dc|<=r/[64(1+|dp|+r|dlam/rho|+sum(|dk_n|r^n))]`, `|dlam dc|<0.01|rho|`; else fallback | First-order parameter sensitivity estimate; empirical domain, not a rigorous error certificate. |
| Derivative consistency | Directly evaluate **one local period** from the chart exit predecessor; compare state with `K(lambda*w)` (relative 1e-7) and `dz/dc` with the differentiated Koenigs identity (relative 2e-4); else fallback | Differentiated conjugacy is an exact mathematical identity; polynomial truncation, phase arithmetic and thresholds are empirical checks, not a proven remainder. |
| Profitability | Before rendering, compare `T_discover+T_build+0.26 us*pixel_count` to `0.50 us*pixel_count` with 5% margin; if it loses, **decline**, no jump | Empirical cost model calibrated from an earlier 960x540 guarded run; machine-dependent, no BLA truth run consulted for a decision. |

The PROB-20 zone first-return truncation gate is *not* used or assumed.
`--force` is a research-only override of the profitability choice. The
BLA control is only a retrospective acceptance check, now scored with
`fd compare` (class, nu, de, normal). An unprofitable camera `c=i`,
width `1e-4`, must log `"pre_render_decision":"decline"` and no jumps.

The one added `.github/workflows/auto-misiurewicz.yml` runs 3 independent
cold 960x540 trials each at `c=i`, q=3,p=2, and a 0.1-width real offset
from each, saving `fd compare` records and reporting speedup median/range.
Local Ryzen 9 3900X commands (24 threads):

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo test --manifest-path tools/research/misiurewicz/auto_cycle_bench/Cargo.toml
cargo build --release -p fd-cli
cargo build --release --manifest-path tools/research/misiurewicz/auto_cycle_bench/Cargo.toml
python3 -m pip install mpmath numpy
python3 tools/research/misiurewicz/auto_discover.py --fd target/release/fd --native tools/research/misiurewicz/auto_cycle_bench/target/release/native-cycles --re 0 --im 1 --width 1e-95 --size 960x540 --iter 20000 --threads 24 --out out/auto01-i-run1

```

Repeat each successful command independently three times with distinct `--out`
paths for median and min/max. For all four exact target coordinates, see
the workflow's `cameras.txt` generation; no performance measurements from
this branch are claimed until its remote workflow finishes.

**AUTO-01 guarded acceptance measurements** — GitHub Actions
[run 38077355119](https://github.com/junovhs/fractodactyl/actions/runs/38077355119),
Ubuntu hosted 4-vCPU runner, Python 3.12 with mpmath/numpy/gmpy2,
native Rust release, 4 threads, 960x540, width 1e-95, max_iter 20,000,
three independent cold invocations per camera. Each trial counted
discovery + operator build/serialization + native process/render against
same-runner `fd control --bla per-frame` cold seconds. `fd compare`
was only run *after* the pre-render choice and did not influence it.
Off-centre targets shift the real component by +1e-96 (0.1 frame width).
The q=3,p=2 exact centre is written above in the research note.

| Camera | Cold speedup median | 3-run min–max | Max equivalent nu displacement (px) | Largest scored de relative error | Largest scored normal error (deg) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| c=i | 1.4151x | 1.3237–1.4172x | 1.54e-11 | 6.06e-8 | 0 |
| c=i, off-centre | 1.2875x | 1.2781–1.2989x | 1.56e-11 | 0 | 0 |
| q=3,p=2 | 1.2745x | 1.2717–1.2775x | 3.73e-11 | 8.21e-8 | 0 |
| q=3,p=2, off-centre | 1.2650x | 1.2603–1.2685x | 9.52e-11 | 0 | 0 |

**Gate:** all 6,220,800 samples across 12 whole frames passed
`fd compare`: 0 classification mismatches, 0 nu samples over 1e-3 px,
0 de tolerance failures and 0 normal tolerance failures, 0 nonfinite.
Native fast-chart table was enabled in all trials, with 518,400 jump
samples each; these tested views had no fallback samples. For nonzero
fallback counts, test a broader corpus under AUTO-02 before production.
At c=i, width 1e-4, the compiler declined prior to any rendering
(no cycle operator build); the separate 64x36 profitability-decline
regression also passed: predicted 0.0767 s total auto vs 0.001152 s
cold BLA, so no rendering occurred and 0 jumps were issued. An earlier, non-optimized guarded
version correctly scored all pixels but lost to BLA (0.58–0.70x medians);
the fast phase-offset finishing path is essential to the win.
